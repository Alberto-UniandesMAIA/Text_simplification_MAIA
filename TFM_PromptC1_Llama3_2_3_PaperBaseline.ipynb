Two of these treatments \\u2010 bupropion (sometimes called Zyban) and nortriptyline \\u2010 are sometimes given to help people quit smoking. This review looks at whether using antidepressants actually helps people to stop smoking (for six months or longer), and also looks at the safety of using these medicines. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThis review includes 115 studies looking at how helpful and safe different antidepressants are when used to quit smoking. Most of the studies were conducted in adults. We included studies of any length when looking at safety, but studies needed to be at least six months long when assessing whether people had managed to quit smoking. The evidence is up to date to May 2019. \\nKey results \\nUsing the antidepressant, bupropion, makes it 52% to 77% more likely that a person will successfully stop smoking, which is equal to five to seven more people successfully quitting for six months or more for every one hundred people who try to quit. There is evidence that people who use the antidepressant, nortriptyline, to quit smoking also improve their chances of success. There is not enough evidence to determine whether other antidepressants help people to quit smoking. \\nThere is evidence that bupropion increases unwanted effects, particularly those relating to mental health, and that unwanted effects may increase the chance that people stop using the medicine. However, the evidence does not suggest that bupropion is more likely to result in death, hospitalization, or life\\u2010threatening events, like seizures. There is not enough information to draw clear conclusions about the safety of nortriptyline for stopping smoking. \\nThe evidence does not suggest that taking bupropion at the same time as other stop\\u2010smoking medicines, like varenicline (sometimes known as Champix or Chantix) or nicotine replacement therapy makes people more likely to quit smoking. People are as likely to quit smoking when using bupropion as when using nortriptyline or nicotine replacement therapy, however people using varenicline are more likely to quit than those using bupropion.\",\n          \"Absorbable stitches for repair of episiotomy and tears at childbirth\\nApproximately 70% of women who have a vaginal birth will experience some degree of damage to the perineum, due to a tear or cut (episiotomy), and will need stitches. This damage may result in perineal pain during the two weeks after the birth, and some women experience long\\u2010term pain and discomfort during sexual intercourse. The impact of perineal trauma can be distressing for the new mother when she is trying to cope with hormonal changes and the demands of her baby, and it can have a long\\u2010term effect on her sexual relationship. Most modern materials that are used to stitch the perineum are gradually absorbed and do not need to be taken out. Sometimes, however, stitches have to be removed by the doctor or midwife. A small number of perineal wounds come open (break down) or have delayed healing, and some of these may need to be re\\u2010stitched. \\nThis review includes 18 randomised controlled trials with 10,171 women and looks at catgut and synthetic materials used to stitch the perineum after childbirth. It also includes a more recently produced material which has been specially designed to be absorbed more quickly. The main findings were that women stitched with synthetic materials had less pain in the first three days after delivery and needed fewer drugs to relieve pain in the 10 days after giving birth, compared with women stitched with catgut. There was evidence that synthetic stitches were not always readily absorbed and some women with these stitches needed them to be removed. Women experienced similar short and long\\u2010term pain with standard absorbable synthetic materials and more rapidly absorbing stitches. However, in one trial, fewer women with rapidly absorbing stitches reported using pain\\u2010relieving drugs during the 10 days after delivery, and there was less need for these stitches to be removed. When catgut and glycerol\\u2010impregnated catgut were compared the results were similar, although the latter was associated with more short\\u2010term pain. One trial examined monofilament and standard synthetic stitches and there was little difference between the two materials in terms of pain and wound healing. As well as the type of material used, other factors such as the technique used to carry out the stitching (using a continuous thread or a series of separately tied stitches) and the skill of the person carrying out the procedure, may also affect the amount of pain and the way perineal wounds heal.\",\n          \"Topical preparations for preventing stretch marks in pregnancy\\nStretch marks commonly develop during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. They affect 50% to 90% of women. They appear as red lines or streaks that fade slowly after the pregnancy to leave pale lines on the skin. The abdomen, breasts and thighs are most often affected. They do not disappear entirely, therefore any treatment which prevents them would be welcomed by many women. In this review, we identified randomised controlled trials and quasi\\u2010randomised controlled trials that compared topical creams, lotions and ointments containing active ingredients with placebo or no treatment, and topical preparations with active ingredients versus other topical preparations. \\nWe included six trials (involving 800 women) in this review. We found that the application of a skin preparation to the areas affected by stretch marks during pregnancy did not prevent the development of stretch marks in the women during pregnancy. Only three trials (involving 461 women) looked at the severity of the stretch marks and did not show a clear difference. The preparations used included Alphastria, Trofolastin, Verum, olive oil and cocoa butter, which all contain vitamin E; Alphastria and Verum also have hyaluronic acid. Of the six trials, we judged three to be at low risk of bias. All trials were relatively small, with four of the six trials each including less than 100 women. The trials were also different in terms of when the women first started to use the topical applications, ranging from the first trimester to the first 20 weeks.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"non_pls\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Background\\nWhilst the pharmacological profiles and mechanisms of antidepressants are varied, there are common reasons why they might help people to stop smoking tobacco. Firstly, nicotine withdrawal may produce depressive symptoms and antidepressants may relieve these. Additionally, some antidepressants may have a specific effect on neural pathways or receptors that underlie nicotine addiction. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the evidence for the efficacy, safety and tolerability of medications with antidepressant properties in assisting long\\u2010term tobacco smoking cessation in people who smoke cigarettes. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Specialized Register, which includes reports of trials indexed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, clinicaltrials.gov, the ICTRP, and other reviews and meeting abstracts, in May 2019. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited smokers, and compared antidepressant medications with placebo or no treatment, an alternative pharmacotherapy, or the same medication used in a different way. We excluded trials with less than six months follow\\u2010up from efficacy analyses. We included trials with any follow\\u2010up length in safety analyses. \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe extracted data and assessed risk of bias using standard Cochrane methods. We also used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. \\nThe primary outcome measure was smoking cessation after at least six months follow\\u2010up, expressed as a risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta\\u2010analysis using a fixed\\u2010effect model. \\nSimilarly, we presented incidence of safety and tolerance outcomes, including adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), psychiatric AEs, seizures, overdoses, suicide attempts, death by suicide, all\\u2010cause mortality, and trial dropout due to drug, as RRs (95% CIs). \\nMain results\\nWe included 115 studies (33 new to this update) in this review; most recruited adult participants from the community or from smoking cessation clinics. We judged 28 of the studies to be at high risk of bias; however, restricting analyses only to studies at low or unclear risk did not change clinical interpretation of the results. There was high\\u2010certainty evidence that bupropion increased long\\u2010term smoking cessation rates (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.52 to 1.77; I2 = 15%; 45 studies, 17,866 participants). There was insufficient evidence to establish whether participants taking bupropion were more likely to report SAEs compared to those taking placebo. Results were imprecise and CIs encompassed no difference (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.48; I2 = 0%; 21 studies, 10,625 participants; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence, downgraded one level due to imprecision). We found high\\u2010certainty evidence that use of bupropion resulted in more trial dropouts due to adverse events of the drug than placebo (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.56; I2 = 19%; 25 studies, 12,340 participants). Participants randomized to bupropion were also more likely to report psychiatric AEs compared with those randomized to placebo (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.37; I2 = 15%; 6 studies, 4439 participants). \\nWe also looked at the safety and efficacy of bupropion when combined with other non\\u2010antidepressant smoking cessation therapies. There was insufficient evidence to establish whether combination bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) resulted in superior quit rates to NRT alone (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.51; I2 = 52%; 12 studies, 3487 participants), or whether combination bupropion and varenicline resulted in superior quit rates to varenicline alone (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.55; I2 = 15%; 3 studies, 1057 participants). We judged the certainty of evidence to be low and moderate, respectively; in both cases due to imprecision, and also due to inconsistency in the former. Safety data were sparse for these comparisons, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions. \\nA meta\\u2010analysis of six studies provided evidence that bupropion resulted in inferior smoking cessation rates to varenicline (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.79; I2 = 0%; 6 studies, 6286 participants), whilst there was no evidence of a difference in efficacy between bupropion and NRT (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09; I2 = 18%; 10 studies, 8230 participants). \\nWe also found some evidence that nortriptyline aided smoking cessation when compared with placebo (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78; I2 = 16%; 6 studies, 975 participants), whilst there was insufficient evidence to determine whether bupropion or nortriptyline were more effective when compared with one another (RR 1.30 (favouring bupropion), 95% CI 0.93 to 1.82; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 417 participants). There was no evidence that any of the other antidepressants tested (including St John's Wort, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)) had a beneficial effect on smoking cessation. Findings were sparse and inconsistent as to whether antidepressants, primarily bupropion and nortriptyline, had a particular benefit for people with current or previous depression. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nThere is high\\u2010certainty evidence that bupropion can aid long\\u2010term smoking cessation. However, bupropion also increases the number of adverse events, including psychiatric AEs, and there is high\\u2010certainty evidence that people taking bupropion are more likely to discontinue treatment compared with placebo. However, there is no clear evidence to suggest whether people taking bupropion experience more or fewer SAEs than those taking placebo (moderate certainty). Nortriptyline also appears to have a beneficial effect on smoking quit rates relative to placebo. Evidence suggests that bupropion may be as successful as NRT and nortriptyline in helping people to quit smoking, but that it is less effective than varenicline. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether the other antidepressants tested, such as SSRIs, aid smoking cessation, and when looking at safety and tolerance outcomes, in most cases, paucity of data made it difficult to draw conclusions. Due to the high\\u2010certainty evidence, further studies investigating the efficacy of bupropion versus placebo are unlikely to change our interpretation of the effect, providing no clear justification for pursuing bupropion for smoking cessation over front\\u2010line smoking cessation aids already available. However, it is important that where studies of antidepressants for smoking cessation are carried out they measure and report safety and tolerability clearly.\",\n          \"Background\\nApproximately 70% of women will experience perineal trauma following vaginal delivery and will require stitches. This may result in pain, suture removal and superficial dyspareunia. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the effects of different suture materials on short\\u2010 and long\\u2010term morbidity following perineal repair. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (February 2010). \\nSelection criteria\\nRandomised trials comparing different suture materials for perineal repair after vaginal delivery. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.\\nMain results\\nWe included 18 trials with 10,171 women; comparisons included: catgut with standard synthetic (nine trials), rapidly absorbing synthetic (two trials), and glycerol impregnated catgut sutures (two trials); and standard synthetic sutures with rapidly absorbing synthetic (five trials) and monofilament sutures (one trial). \\nCompared with catgut, standard synthetic sutures were associated with less pain up to three days after delivery (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.90); and less analgesia up to ten days postpartum (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.87). More women with catgut sutures required resuturing (15/1201) compared with synthetic sutures (3/1201) (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.74); while more women with standard synthetic sutures required the removal of unabsorbed suture material (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.46 to 2.24). Comparing standard synthetic with rapidly absorbing sutures, short\\u2010 and long\\u2010term pain were similar; in one trial fewer women with rapidly absorbing sutures reported using analgesics at 10 days (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77). More women in the standard synthetic suture group required suture removal compared with those in the rapidly absorbed group (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.36). There was no evidence of significant differences between groups for long\\u2010term pain (three months after delivery) or for dyspareunia at three, or at six to 12 months. When catgut and glycerol impregnated catgut were compared, results were similar for most outcomes, although the latter was associated with more short\\u2010term pain. One trial examining monofilament versus standard polyglycolic sutures found no differences for most outcomes. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nCatgut may increase short\\u2010term pain compared with synthetic sutures. There were few differences between standard and rapidly absorbing synthetic sutures but more women needed standard sutures removing. For other materials, there was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions. Findings should be interpreted in the context of the related Cochrane review on suturing techniques.\",\n          \"Background\\nStriae gravidarum (stretch marks developing during pregnancy) occur in 50% to 90% of women. They appear as red or purple lines or streaks that fade slowly to leave pale lines or marks on the skin. The abdomen, breasts and thighs are commonly affected. The exact cause of stretch marks is unclear and no preparation has yet been shown to be effective in preventing the development of stretch marks. They are a source of significant anxiety for women, impacting on their quality of life. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the effects of topical preparations on the prevention of stretch marks in pregnancy. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 October 2011) and reference lists of retrieved reports. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included randomised controlled trials and quasi\\u2010randomised controlled trials comparing topical preparations (with active ingredients) with other topical preparations (with active ingredients), with a placebo (that is, preparations without active ingredients) or with no treatment for the prevention of stretch marks in pregnant women. \\nData collection and analysis\\nThree review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and trial quality, and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. The primary outcome was the presence of stretch marks and the secondary outcome was the severity of stretch marks. \\nMain results\\nWe included six trials involving 800 women. Of the six trials, we judged the risk of bias for three as 'low risk' for random sequence generation, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, completeness of outcome data and selective reporting. \\nThere was no statistically significant average difference in the development of stretch marks in women who received topical preparations with active ingredients compared to women who received a placebo or no treatment (average risk ratio (RR) 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 1.03; five trials, 474 women; random\\u2010effects model, Tau\\u00b2 = 0.09, I\\u00b2 = 65%) (Analysis 1.1). \\nResults were consistent with the main effects when we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding studies judged to be at high risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment or more than 20% missing data for a given outcome (average RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.10; four trials, 424 women; random\\u2010effects model, Tau\\u00b2 = 0.05, I\\u00b2 = 57%). \\nThe was no statistically significant average mean difference in the severity of stretch marks (standardised mean difference (SMD) \\u20100.31; 95% CI \\u20101.06 to 0.44; two trials, 255 women; Tau\\u00b2 = 0.26, I\\u00b2 = 87%). \\nThere was no statistically significant difference in the development of stretch marks in women who received topical preparations with active ingredients compared to women who received other topical preparations with active ingredients (average RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.60; two trials, 305 women; Tau\\u00b2 = 0.53, I\\u00b2 = 74%). There was no statistically significant difference in the severity of stretch marks (mean difference (MD) \\u20100.20; 95% CI \\u20100.53 to 0.13; one trial, 206 women; heterogeneity not applicable). \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nWe found no high\\u2010quality evidence to support the use of any of the topical preparations in the prevention of stretch marks during pregnancy. There is a clear need for robust, methodologically rigorous randomised trials involving larger sample sizes to evaluate the effects of topical preparations on the development of stretch marks in pregnancy. In addition, it is important that preparations commonly used by women to prevent and treat stretch marks are evaluated within the context of robust, methodologically rigorous and adequately powered randomised trials.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They appear as red or purple lines or streaks that fade slowly to leave pale lines or marks on the skin. The abdomen, breasts and thighs are commonly affected. The exact cause of stretch marks is unclear and no preparation has yet been shown to be effective in preventing the development of stretch marks. They are a source of significant anxiety for women, impacting on their quality of life. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the effects of topical preparations on the prevention of stretch marks in pregnancy. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 October 2011) and reference lists of retrieved reports. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included randomised controlled trials and quasi\\u2010randomised controlled trials comparing topical preparations (with active ingredients) with other topical preparations (with active ingredients), with a placebo (that is, preparations without active ingredients) or with no treatment for the prevention of stretch marks in pregnant women. \\nData collection and analysis\\nThree review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and trial quality, and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. The primary outcome was the presence of stretch marks and the secondary outcome was the severity of stretch marks. \\nMain results\\nWe included six trials involving 800 women. Of the six trials, we judged the risk of bias for three as 'low risk' for random sequence generation, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, completeness of outcome data and selective reporting. \\nThere was no statistically significant average difference in the development of stretch marks in women who received topical preparations with active ingredients compared to women who received a placebo or no treatment (average risk ratio (RR) 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 1.03; five trials, 474 women; random\\u2010effects model, Tau\\u00b2 = 0.09, I\\u00b2 = 65%) (Analysis 1.1). \\nResults were consistent with the main effects when we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding studies judged to be at high risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment or more than 20% missing data for a given outcome (average RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.10; four trials, 424 women; random\\u2010effects model, Tau\\u00b2 = 0.05, I\\u00b2 = 57%). \\nThe was no statistically significant average mean difference in the severity of stretch marks (standardised mean difference (SMD) \\u20100.31; 95% CI \\u20101.06 to 0.44; two trials, 255 women; Tau\\u00b2 = 0.26, I\\u00b2 = 87%). \\nThere was no statistically significant difference in the development of stretch marks in women who received topical preparations with active ingredients compared to women who received other topical preparations with active ingredients (average RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.60; two trials, 305 women; Tau\\u00b2 = 0.53, I\\u00b2 = 74%). There was no statistically significant difference in the severity of stretch marks (mean difference (MD) \\u20100.20; 95% CI \\u20100.53 to 0.13; one trial, 206 women; heterogeneity not applicable). \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nWe found no high\\u2010quality evidence to support the use of any of the topical preparations in the prevention of stretch marks during pregnancy. There is a clear need for robust, methodologically rigorous randomised trials involving larger sample sizes to evaluate the effects of topical preparations on the development of stretch marks in pregnancy. In addition, it is important that preparations commonly used by women to prevent and treat stretch marks are evaluated within the context of robust, methodologically rigorous and adequately powered randomised trials.\",\n          \"Background\\nIn acute asthma inhaled beta\\u2082\\u2010agonists are often administered by nebuliser to relieve bronchospasm, but some have argued that metered\\u2010dose inhalers with a holding chamber (spacer) can be equally effective. Nebulisers require a power source and need regular maintenance, and are more expensive in the community setting. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the effects of holding chambers (spacers) compared to nebulisers for the delivery of beta\\u2082\\u2010agonists for acute asthma. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trial Register and reference lists of articles. We contacted the authors of studies to identify additional trials. Date of last search: February 2013. \\nSelection criteria\\nRandomised trials in adults and children (from two years of age) with asthma, where spacer beta\\u2082\\u2010agonist delivery was compared with wet nebulisation. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors independently applied study inclusion criteria (one review author for the first version of the review), extracted the data and assessed risks of bias. Missing data were obtained from the authors or estimated. Results are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). \\nMain results\\nThis review includes a total of 1897 children and 729 adults in 39 trials. Thirty\\u2010three trials were conducted in the emergency room and equivalent community settings, and six trials were on inpatients with acute asthma (207 children and 28 adults). The method of delivery of beta\\u2082\\u2010agonist did not show a significant difference in hospital admission rates. In adults, the risk ratio (RR) of admission for spacer versus nebuliser was 0.94 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.43). The risk ratio for children was 0.71 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.08, moderate quality evidence). In children, length of stay in the emergency department was significantly shorter when the spacer was used. The mean duration in the emergency department for children given nebulised treatment was 103 minutes, and for children given treatment via spacers 33 minutes less (95% CI \\u201043 to \\u201024 minutes, moderate quality evidence). Length of stay in the emergency department for adults was similar for the two delivery methods. Peak flow and forced expiratory volume were also similar for the two delivery methods. Pulse rate was lower for spacer in children, mean difference \\u20105% baseline (95% CI \\u20108% to \\u20102%, moderate quality evidence), as was the risk of developing tremor (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.95, moderate quality evidence). \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nNebuliser delivery produced outcomes that were not significantly better than metered\\u2010dose inhalers delivered by spacer in adults or children, in trials where treatments were repeated and titrated to the response of the participant. Spacers may have some advantages compared to nebulisers for children with acute asthma. The studies excluded people with life\\u2010threatening asthma; therefore, the results of this meta\\u2010analysis should not be extrapolated to this patient population.\",\n          \"Background\\nWhilst the pharmacological profiles and mechanisms of antidepressants are varied, there are common reasons why they might help people to stop smoking tobacco. Firstly, nicotine withdrawal may produce depressive symptoms and antidepressants may relieve these. Additionally, some antidepressants may have a specific effect on neural pathways or receptors that underlie nicotine addiction. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the evidence for the efficacy, safety and tolerability of medications with antidepressant properties in assisting long\\u2010term tobacco smoking cessation in people who smoke cigarettes. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Specialized Register, which includes reports of trials indexed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, clinicaltrials.gov, the ICTRP, and other reviews and meeting abstracts, in May 2019. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited smokers, and compared antidepressant medications with placebo or no treatment, an alternative pharmacotherapy, or the same medication used in a different way. We excluded trials with less than six months follow\\u2010up from efficacy analyses. We included trials with any follow\\u2010up length in safety analyses. \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe extracted data and assessed risk of bias using standard Cochrane methods. We also used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. \\nThe primary outcome measure was smoking cessation after at least six months follow\\u2010up, expressed as a risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta\\u2010analysis using a fixed\\u2010effect model. \\nSimilarly, we presented incidence of safety and tolerance outcomes, including adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), psychiatric AEs, seizures, overdoses, suicide attempts, death by suicide, all\\u2010cause mortality, and trial dropout due to drug, as RRs (95% CIs). \\nMain results\\nWe included 115 studies (33 new to this update) in this review; most recruited adult participants from the community or from smoking cessation clinics. We judged 28 of the studies to be at high risk of bias; however, restricting analyses only to studies at low or unclear risk did not change clinical interpretation of the results. There was high\\u2010certainty evidence that bupropion increased long\\u2010term smoking cessation rates (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.52 to 1.77; I2 = 15%; 45 studies, 17,866 participants). There was insufficient evidence to establish whether participants taking bupropion were more likely to report SAEs compared to those taking placebo. Results were imprecise and CIs encompassed no difference (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.48; I2 = 0%; 21 studies, 10,625 participants; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence, downgraded one level due to imprecision). We found high\\u2010certainty evidence that use of bupropion resulted in more trial dropouts due to adverse events of the drug than placebo (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.56; I2 = 19%; 25 studies, 12,340 participants). Participants randomized to bupropion were also more likely to report psychiatric AEs compared with those randomized to placebo (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.37; I2 = 15%; 6 studies, 4439 participants). \\nWe also looked at the safety and efficacy of bupropion when combined with other non\\u2010antidepressant smoking cessation therapies. There was insufficient evidence to establish whether combination bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) resulted in superior quit rates to NRT alone (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.51; I2 = 52%; 12 studies, 3487 participants), or whether combination bupropion and varenicline resulted in superior quit rates to varenicline alone (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.55; I2 = 15%; 3 studies, 1057 participants). We judged the certainty of evidence to be low and moderate, respectively; in both cases due to imprecision, and also due to inconsistency in the former. Safety data were sparse for these comparisons, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions. \\nA meta\\u2010analysis of six studies provided evidence that bupropion resulted in inferior smoking cessation rates to varenicline (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.79; I2 = 0%; 6 studies, 6286 participants), whilst there was no evidence of a difference in efficacy between bupropion and NRT (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09; I2 = 18%; 10 studies, 8230 participants). \\nWe also found some evidence that nortriptyline aided smoking cessation when compared with placebo (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78; I2 = 16%; 6 studies, 975 participants), whilst there was insufficient evidence to determine whether bupropion or nortriptyline were more effective when compared with one another (RR 1.30 (favouring bupropion), 95% CI 0.93 to 1.82; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 417 participants). There was no evidence that any of the other antidepressants tested (including St John's Wort, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)) had a beneficial effect on smoking cessation. Findings were sparse and inconsistent as to whether antidepressants, primarily bupropion and nortriptyline, had a particular benefit for people with current or previous depression. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nThere is high\\u2010certainty evidence that bupropion can aid long\\u2010term smoking cessation. However, bupropion also increases the number of adverse events, including psychiatric AEs, and there is high\\u2010certainty evidence that people taking bupropion are more likely to discontinue treatment compared with placebo. However, there is no clear evidence to suggest whether people taking bupropion experience more or fewer SAEs than those taking placebo (moderate certainty). Nortriptyline also appears to have a beneficial effect on smoking quit rates relative to placebo. Evidence suggests that bupropion may be as successful as NRT and nortriptyline in helping people to quit smoking, but that it is less effective than varenicline. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether the other antidepressants tested, such as SSRIs, aid smoking cessation, and when looking at safety and tolerance outcomes, in most cases, paucity of data made it difficult to draw conclusions. Due to the high\\u2010certainty evidence, further studies investigating the efficacy of bupropion versus placebo are unlikely to change our interpretation of the effect, providing no clear justification for pursuing bupropion for smoking cessation over front\\u2010line smoking cessation aids already available. However, it is important that where studies of antidepressants for smoking cessation are carried out they measure and report safety and tolerability clearly.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Topical preparations for preventing stretch marks in pregnancy\\nStretch marks commonly develop during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. They affect 50% to 90% of women. They appear as red lines or streaks that fade slowly after the pregnancy to leave pale lines on the skin. The abdomen, breasts and thighs are most often affected. They do not disappear entirely, therefore any treatment which prevents them would be welcomed by many women. In this review, we identified randomised controlled trials and quasi\\u2010randomised controlled trials that compared topical creams, lotions and ointments containing active ingredients with placebo or no treatment, and topical preparations with active ingredients versus other topical preparations. \\nWe included six trials (involving 800 women) in this review. We found that the application of a skin preparation to the areas affected by stretch marks during pregnancy did not prevent the development of stretch marks in the women during pregnancy. Only three trials (involving 461 women) looked at the severity of the stretch marks and did not show a clear difference. The preparations used included Alphastria, Trofolastin, Verum, olive oil and cocoa butter, which all contain vitamin E; Alphastria and Verum also have hyaluronic acid. Of the six trials, we judged three to be at low risk of bias. All trials were relatively small, with four of the six trials each including less than 100 women. The trials were also different in terms of when the women first started to use the topical applications, ranging from the first trimester to the first 20 weeks.\",\n          \"Holding chambers (spacers) versus nebulisers for delivery of beta\\u2010agonist relievers in the treatment of an asthma attack \\nReview question \\nWhen someone is having an asthma attack is it as safe and effective to use a spacer instead of a nebuliser? \\nBackground \\nDuring an asthma attack, the airways (tubes in the lungs) narrow making breathing difficult. The initial response to an asthma attack is to treat with a drug that can open up the airways and make breathing easier. These drugs are called bronchodilators and in this review we are looking specifically at a class of bronchodilators called beta\\u2010agonists (for example salbutamol). These drugs can be taken straight from an inhaler, but during an asthma attack they are easier to take using either a spacer or a nebuliser. A spacer is a hollow chamber. A puff of drug from an inhaler is added to the chamber and then the person breathes in and out normally (also described as tidal breathing), from a mouthpiece on the chamber. A nebuliser is a machine with a mask that goes over the person's mouth and nose and through which a constant stream of drug and air (or oxygen) is breathed in and out normally. \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nWe found 39 clinical trials involving 1897 children and 729 adults. Thirty\\u2010three of the trials were conducted in an emergency room (or emergency department) and community settings (such as a GP's surgery), and six trials were on inpatients (people in hospital) with acute asthma (207 children and 28 adults). Overall we judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate. \\nWhat do the studies tell us? \\nTaking beta\\u2010agonists through either a spacer or a nebuliser in the emergency department did not make a difference to the number of adults being admitted to hospital, whilst in children we can be fairly confident that nebulisers are not better than spacers at preventing admissions.\",\n          \"Do medicines used to treat depression help people to quit smoking?\\nBackground and review questions \\nSome medicines and supplements that have been used to treat depression (antidepressants) have also been tested to see whether they can help people to stop smoking. Two of these treatments \\u2010 bupropion (sometimes called Zyban) and nortriptyline \\u2010 are sometimes given to help people quit smoking. This review looks at whether using antidepressants actually helps people to stop smoking (for six months or longer), and also looks at the safety of using these medicines. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThis review includes 115 studies looking at how helpful and safe different antidepressants are when used to quit smoking. Most of the studies were conducted in adults. We included studies of any length when looking at safety, but studies needed to be at least six months long when assessing whether people had managed to quit smoking. The evidence is up to date to May 2019. \\nKey results \\nUsing the antidepressant, bupropion, makes it 52% to 77% more likely that a person will successfully stop smoking, which is equal to five to seven more people successfully quitting for six months or more for every one hundred people who try to quit. There is evidence that people who use the antidepressant, nortriptyline, to quit smoking also improve their chances of success. There is not enough evidence to determine whether other antidepressants help people to quit smoking. \\nThere is evidence that bupropion increases unwanted effects, particularly those relating to mental health, and that unwanted effects may increase the chance that people stop using the medicine. However, the evidence does not suggest that bupropion is more likely to result in death, hospitalization, or life\\u2010threatening events, like seizures. There is not enough information to draw clear conclusions about the safety of nortriptyline for stopping smoking. \\nThe evidence does not suggest that taking bupropion at the same time as other stop\\u2010smoking medicines, like varenicline (sometimes known as Champix or Chantix) or nicotine replacement therapy makes people more likely to quit smoking. People are as likely to quit smoking when using bupropion as when using nortriptyline or nicotine replacement therapy, however people using varenicline are more likely to quit than those using bupropion.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_for_generation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Background Striae gravidarum (stretch marks developing during pregnancy) occur in 50% to 90% of women.

Authors' conclusions We found no high\\u2010quality evidence to support the use of any of the topical preparations in the prevention of stretch marks during pregnancy. There is a clear need for robust, methodologically rigorous randomised trials involving larger sample sizes to evaluate the effects of topical preparations on the development of stretch marks in pregnancy.

They appear as red or purple lines or streaks that fade slowly to leave pale lines or marks on the skin. The abdomen, breasts and thighs are commonly affected.

In addition, it is important that preparations commonly used by women to prevent and treat stretch marks are evaluated within the context of robust, methodologically rigorous and adequately powered randomised trials.\",\n          \"Background\\nIn acute asthma inhaled beta\\u2082\\u2010agonists are often administered by nebuliser to relieve bronchospasm, but some have argued that metered\\u2010dose inhalers with a holding chamber (spacer) can be equally effective. Nebulisers require a power source and need regular maintenance, and are more expensive in the community setting. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the effects of holding chambers (spacers) compared to nebulisers for the delivery of beta\\u2082\\u2010agonists for acute asthma. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trial Register and reference lists of articles. We contacted the authors of studies to identify additional trials. Date of last search: February 2013. \\nSelection criteria\\nRandomised trials in adults and children (from two years of age) with asthma, where spacer beta\\u2082\\u2010agonist delivery was compared with wet nebulisation. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors independently applied study inclusion criteria (one review author for the first version of the review), extracted the data and assessed risks of bias. Missing data were obtained from the authors or estimated. Results are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). \\nMain results\\nThis review includes a total of 1897 children and 729 adults in 39 trials. Thirty\\u2010three trials were conducted in the emergency room and equivalent community settings, and six trials were on inpatients with acute asthma (207 children and 28 adults). The method of delivery of beta\\u2082\\u2010agonist did not show a significant difference in hospital admission rates. In adults, the risk ratio (RR) of admission for spacer versus nebuliser was 0.94 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.43). The risk ratio for children was 0.71 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.08, moderate quality evidence). In children, length of stay in the emergency department was significantly shorter when the spacer was used. The mean duration in the emergency department for children given nebulised treatment was 103 minutes, and for children given treatment via spacers 33 minutes less (95% CI \\u201043 to \\u201024 minutes, moderate quality evidence). Length of stay in the emergency department for adults was similar for the two delivery methods. Peak flow and forced expiratory volume were also similar for the two delivery methods. Pulse rate was lower for spacer in children, mean difference \\u20105% baseline (95% CI \\u20108% to \\u20102%, moderate quality evidence), as was the risk of developing tremor (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.95, moderate quality evidence). \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nNebuliser delivery produced outcomes that were not significantly better than metered\\u2010dose inhalers delivered by spacer in adults or children, in trials where treatments were repeated and titrated to the response of the participant. Spacers may have some advantages compared to nebulisers for children with acute asthma. The studies excluded people with life\\u2010threatening asthma; therefore, the results of this meta\\u2010analysis should not be extrapolated to this patient population.\",\n          \"Background\\nWhilst the pharmacological profiles and mechanisms of antidepressants are varied, there are common reasons why they might help people to stop smoking tobacco. Firstly, nicotine withdrawal may produce depressive symptoms and antidepressants may relieve these. Additionally, some antidepressants may have a specific effect on neural pathways or receptors that underlie nicotine addiction. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the evidence for the efficacy, safety and tolerability of medications with antidepressant properties in assisting long\\u2010term tobacco smoking cessation in people who smoke cigarettes. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Specialized Register, which includes reports of trials indexed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, clinicaltrials.gov, the ICTRP, and other reviews and meeting abstracts, in May 2019. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited smokers, and compared antidepressant medications with placebo or no treatment, an alternative pharmacotherapy, or the same medication used in a different way. We excluded trials with less than six months follow\\u2010up from efficacy analyses. We included trials with any follow\\u2010up length in safety analyses. \\nData collection and analysis\\nWe extracted data and assessed risk of bias using standard Cochrane methods. We also used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. \\nThe primary outcome measure was smoking cessation after at least six months follow\\u2010up, expressed as a risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta\\u2010analysis using a fixed\\u2010effect model. \\nSimilarly, we presented incidence of safety and tolerance outcomes, including adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), psychiatric AEs, seizures, overdoses, suicide attempts, death by suicide, all\\u2010cause mortality, and trial dropout due to drug, as RRs (95% CIs). \\nMain results\\nWe included 115 studies (33 new to this update) in this review; most recruited adult participants from the community or from smoking cessation clinics. We judged 28 of the studies to be at high risk of bias; however, restricting analyses only to studies at low or unclear risk did not change clinical interpretation of the results. There was high\\u2010certainty evidence that bupropion increased long\\u2010term smoking cessation rates (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.52 to 1.77; I2 = 15%; 45 studies, 17,866 participants). There was insufficient evidence to establish whether participants taking bupropion were more likely to report SAEs compared to those taking placebo. Results were imprecise and CIs encompassed no difference (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.48; I2 = 0%; 21 studies, 10,625 participants; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence, downgraded one level due to imprecision). We found high\\u2010certainty evidence that use of bupropion resulted in more trial dropouts due to adverse events of the drug than placebo (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.56; I2 = 19%; 25 studies, 12,340 participants). Participants randomized to bupropion were also more likely to report psychiatric AEs compared with those randomized to placebo (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.37; I2 = 15%; 6 studies, 4439 participants). \\nWe also looked at the safety and efficacy of bupropion when combined with other non\\u2010antidepressant smoking cessation therapies. There was insufficient evidence to establish whether combination bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) resulted in superior quit rates to NRT alone (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.51; I2 = 52%; 12 studies, 3487 participants), or whether combination bupropion and varenicline resulted in superior quit rates to varenicline alone (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.55; I2 = 15%; 3 studies, 1057 participants). We judged the certainty of evidence to be low and moderate, respectively; in both cases due to imprecision, and also due to inconsistency in the former. Safety data were sparse for these comparisons, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions. \\nA meta\\u2010analysis of six studies provided evidence that bupropion resulted in inferior smoking cessation rates to varenicline (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.79; I2 = 0%; 6 studies, 6286 participants), whilst there was no evidence of a difference in efficacy between bupropion and NRT (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09; I2 = 18%; 10 studies, 8230 participants). \\nWe also found some evidence that nortriptyline aided smoking cessation when compared with placebo (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78; I2 = 16%; 6 studies, 975 participants), whilst there was insufficient evidence to determine whether bupropion or nortriptyline were more effective when compared with one another (RR 1.30 (favouring bupropion), 95% CI 0.93 to 1.82; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 417 participants). There was no evidence that any of the other antidepressants tested (including St John's Wort, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)) had a beneficial effect on smoking cessation. Findings were sparse and inconsistent as to whether antidepressants, primarily bupropion and nortriptyline, had a particular benefit for people with current or previous depression. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nThere is high\\u2010certainty evidence that bupropion can aid long\\u2010term smoking cessation. However, bupropion also increases the number of adverse events, including psychiatric AEs, and there is high\\u2010certainty evidence that people taking bupropion are more likely to discontinue treatment compared with placebo. However, there is no clear evidence to suggest whether people taking bupropion experience more or fewer SAEs than those taking placebo (moderate certainty). Nortriptyline also appears to have a beneficial effect on smoking quit rates relative to placebo. Evidence suggests that bupropion may be as successful as NRT and nortriptyline in helping people to quit smoking, but that it is less effective than varenicline. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether the other antidepressants tested, such as SSRIs, aid smoking cessation, and when looking at safety and tolerance outcomes, in most cases, paucity of data made it difficult to draw conclusions. Due to the high\\u2010certainty evidence, further studies investigating the efficacy of bupropion versus placebo are unlikely to change our interpretation of the effect, providing no clear justification for pursuing bupropion for smoking cessation over front\\u2010line smoking cessation aids already available. However, it is important that where studies of antidepressants for smoking cessation are carried out they measure and report safety and tolerability clearly.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Topical preparations for preventing stretch marks in pregnancy\\nStretch marks commonly develop during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. They affect 50% to 90% of women. They appear as red lines or streaks that fade slowly after the pregnancy to leave pale lines on the skin. The abdomen, breasts and thighs are most often affected. They do not disappear entirely, therefore any treatment which prevents them would be welcomed by many women. In this review, we identified randomised controlled trials and quasi\\u2010randomised controlled trials that compared topical creams, lotions and ointments containing active ingredients with placebo or no treatment, and topical preparations with active ingredients versus other topical preparations. \\nWe included six trials (involving 800 women) in this review. We found that the application of a skin preparation to the areas affected by stretch marks during pregnancy did not prevent the development of stretch marks in the women during pregnancy. Only three trials (involving 461 women) looked at the severity of the stretch marks and did not show a clear difference. The preparations used included Alphastria, Trofolastin, Verum, olive oil and cocoa butter, which all contain vitamin E; Alphastria and Verum also have hyaluronic acid. Of the six trials, we judged three to be at low risk of bias. All trials were relatively small, with four of the six trials each including less than 100 women. The trials were also different in terms of when the women first started to use the topical applications, ranging from the first trimester to the first 20 weeks.\",\n          \"Holding chambers (spacers) versus nebulisers for delivery of beta\\u2010agonist relievers in the treatment of an asthma attack \\nReview question \\nWhen someone is having an asthma attack is it as safe and effective to use a spacer instead of a nebuliser? \\nBackground \\nDuring an asthma attack, the airways (tubes in the lungs) narrow making breathing difficult. The initial response to an asthma attack is to treat with a drug that can open up the airways and make breathing easier. These drugs are called bronchodilators and in this review we are looking specifically at a class of bronchodilators called beta\\u2010agonists (for example salbutamol). These drugs can be taken straight from an inhaler, but during an asthma attack they are easier to take using either a spacer or a nebuliser. A spacer is a hollow chamber. A puff of drug from an inhaler is added to the chamber and then the person breathes in and out normally (also described as tidal breathing), from a mouthpiece on the chamber. A nebuliser is a machine with a mask that goes over the person's mouth and nose and through which a constant stream of drug and air (or oxygen) is breathed in and out normally. \\nWhat evidence did we find? \\nWe found 39 clinical trials involving 1897 children and 729 adults. Thirty\\u2010three of the trials were conducted in an emergency room (or emergency department) and community settings (such as a GP's surgery), and six trials were on inpatients (people in hospital) with acute asthma (207 children and 28 adults). Overall we judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate. \\nWhat do the studies tell us? \\nTaking beta\\u2010agonists through either a spacer or a nebuliser in the emergency department did not make a difference to the number of adults being admitted to hospital, whilst in children we can be fairly confident that nebulisers are not better than spacers at preventing admissions.\",\n          \"Do medicines used to treat depression help people to quit smoking?\\nBackground and review questions \\nSome medicines and supplements that have been used to treat depression (antidepressants) have also been tested to see whether they can help people to stop smoking. Two of these treatments \\u2010 bupropion (sometimes called Zyban) and nortriptyline \\u2010 are sometimes given to help people quit smoking. This review looks at whether using antidepressants actually helps people to stop smoking (for six months or longer), and also looks at the safety of using these medicines. \\nStudy characteristics \\nThis review includes 115 studies looking at how helpful and safe different antidepressants are when used to quit smoking. Most of the studies were conducted in adults. We included studies of any length when looking at safety, but studies needed to be at least six months long when assessing whether people had managed to quit smoking. The evidence is up to date to May 2019. \\nKey results \\nUsing the antidepressant, bupropion, makes it 52% to 77% more likely that a person will successfully stop smoking, which is equal to five to seven more people successfully quitting for six months or more for every one hundred people who try to quit. There is evidence that people who use the antidepressant, nortriptyline, to quit smoking also improve their chances of success. There is not enough evidence to determine whether other antidepressants help people to quit smoking. \\nThere is evidence that bupropion increases unwanted effects, particularly those relating to mental health, and that unwanted effects may increase the chance that people stop using the medicine. However, the evidence does not suggest that bupropion is more likely to result in death, hospitalization, or life\\u2010threatening events, like seizures. There is not enough information to draw clear conclusions about the safety of nortriptyline for stopping smoking. \\nThe evidence does not suggest that taking bupropion at the same time as other stop\\u2010smoking medicines, like varenicline (sometimes known as Champix or Chantix) or nicotine replacement therapy makes people more likely to quit smoking. People are as likely to quit smoking when using bupropion as when using nortriptyline or nicotine replacement therapy, however people using varenicline are more likely to quit than those using bupropion.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_for_generation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Background Striae gravidarum (stretch marks developing during pregnancy) occur in 50% to 90% of women.

In addition, it is important that preparations commonly used by women to prevent and treat stretch marks are evaluated within the context of robust, methodologically rigorous and adequately powered randomised trials.\",\n          \"Background\\nIn acute asthma inhaled beta\\u2082\\u2010agonists are often administered by nebuliser to relieve bronchospasm, but some have argued that metered\\u2010dose inhalers with a holding chamber (spacer) can be equally effective. Nebulisers require a power source and need regular maintenance, and are more expensive in the community setting. \\nObjectives\\nTo assess the effects of holding chambers (spacers) compared to nebulisers for the delivery of beta\\u2082\\u2010agonists for acute asthma. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trial Register and reference lists of articles. We contacted the authors of studies to identify additional trials. Date of last search: February 2013. \\nSelection criteria\\nRandomised trials in adults and children (from two years of age) with asthma, where spacer beta\\u2082\\u2010agonist delivery was compared with wet nebulisation. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors independently applied study inclusion criteria (one review author for the first version of the review), extracted the data and assessed risks of bias. Missing data were obtained from the authors or estimated. Results are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). \\nMain results\\nThis review includes a total of 1897 children and 729 adults in 39 trials. Thirty\\u2010three trials were conducted in the emergency room and equivalent community settings, and six trials were on inpatients with acute asthma (207 children and 28 adults). The method of delivery of beta\\u2082\\u2010agonist did not show a significant difference in hospital admission rates. In adults, the risk ratio (RR) of admission for spacer versus nebuliser was 0.94 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.43). The risk ratio for children was 0.71 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.08, moderate quality evidence). In children, length of stay in the emergency department was significantly shorter when the spacer was used. The mean duration in the emergency department for children given nebulised treatment was 103 minutes, and for children given treatment via spacers 33 minutes less (95% CI \\u201043 to \\u201024 minutes, moderate quality evidence). Length of stay in the emergency department for adults was similar for the two delivery methods. Peak flow and forced expiratory volume were also similar for the two delivery methods. Pulse rate was lower for spacer in children, mean difference \\u20105% baseline (95% CI \\u20108% to \\u20102%, moderate quality evidence), as was the risk of developing tremor (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.95, moderate quality evidence). \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nNebuliser delivery produced outcomes that were not significantly better than metered\\u2010dose inhalers delivered by spacer in adults or children, in trials where treatments were repeated and titrated to the response of the participant. Spacers may have some advantages compared to nebulisers for children with acute asthma. The studies excluded people with life\\u2010threatening asthma; therefore, the results of this meta\\u2010analysis should not be extrapolated to this patient population.\",\n          \"Background Whilst the pharmacological profiles and mechanisms of antidepressants are varied, there are common reasons why they might help people to stop smoking tobacco. Firstly, nicotine withdrawal may produce depressive symptoms and antidepressants may relieve these. Additionally, some antidepressants may have a specific effect on neural pathways or receptors that underlie nicotine addiction. Objectives To assess the evidence for the efficacy, safety and tolerability of medications with antidepressant properties in assisting long\\u2010term tobacco smoking cessation in people who smoke cigarettes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Specialized Register, which includes reports of trials indexed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, clinicaltrials.gov, the ICTRP, and other reviews and meeting abstracts, in May 2019. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited smokers, and compared antidepressant medications with placebo or no treatment, an alternative pharmacotherapy, or the same medication used in a different way. We excluded trials with less than six months follow\\u2010up from efficacy analyses. We included trials with any follow\\u2010up length in safety analyses. Data collection and analysis We extracted data and assessed risk of bias using standard Cochrane methods. We also used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. The primary outcome measure was smoking cessation after at least six months follow\\u2010up, expressed as a risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta\\u2010analysis using a fixed\\u2010effect model. Similarly, we presented [...] of the other antidepressants tested (including St John's Wort, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)) had a beneficial effect on smoking cessation. Findings were sparse and inconsistent as to whether antidepressants, primarily bupropion and nortriptyline, had a particular benefit for people with current or previous depression. Authors' conclusions There is high\\u2010certainty evidence that bupropion can aid long\\u2010term smoking cessation. However, bupropion also increases the number of adverse events, including psychiatric AEs, and there is high\\u2010certainty evidence that people taking bupropion are more likely to discontinue treatment compared with placebo. However, there is no clear evidence to suggest whether people taking bupropion experience more or fewer SAEs than those taking placebo (moderate certainty). Nortriptyline also appears to have a beneficial effect on smoking quit rates relative to placebo. Evidence suggests that bupropion may be as successful as NRT and nortriptyline in helping people to quit smoking, but that it is less effective than varenicline. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether the other antidepressants tested, such as SSRIs, aid smoking cessation, and when looking at safety and tolerance outcomes, in most cases, paucity of data made it difficult to draw conclusions. Due to the high\\u2010certainty evidence, further studies investigating the efficacy of bupropion versus placebo are unlikely to change our interpretation of the effect, providing no clear justification for pursuing bupropion for smoking cessation over front\\u2010line smoking cessation aids already available. However, it is important that where studies of antidepressants for smoking cessation are carried out they measure and report safety and tolerability clearly.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Background Striae gravidarum (stretch marks developing during pregnancy) occur in 50% to 90% of women.

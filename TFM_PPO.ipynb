Previous research has shown that LBP that has persisted for several months or years is often associated with psychological and social problems. Multidisciplinary treatments target physical as well as psychological and social aspects of LBP and involve a team of healthcare providers with different professional backgrounds and training. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe collected all the published studies up to February 2014; there were 41 studies (with 6858 participants) that compared multidisciplinary treatment to other treatments. Most studies compared a multidisciplinary treatment to usual care (such as care by a general practitioner) or to treatments that only addressed physical factors (such as exercise or physiotherapy). All the people in the studies had LBP for more than three months and most had received some other sort of treatment previously. \\nKey results \\nThere was moderate quality evidence that multidisciplinary treatment results in larger improvements in pain and daily function than usual care or treatments aimed only at physical factors. The difference was not very large, about 1 point on a 10 point scale for pain, but this may be important for people whose symptoms have not responded to other treatments. There was also moderate evidence that multidisciplinary treatment doubled the likelihood that people were able to work in the next 6 to 12 months compared to treatments aimed at physical factors.\",\n          \"Treatments for male subfertility\\nReview question \\nCochrane authors reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of different treatments for couples with male subfertility. \\nBackground \\nIntra\\u2010uterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are frequently\\u2010used fertility treatments for couples with low male fertility (subfertility). In IUI, the man's sperm is prepared and placed in the womb (uterus). Thus, the sperm is close to the place where the embryo is made (conception site). IUI can be performed with or without ovarian hyperstimulation (OH). In an OH cycle, women receive drugs to stimulate the ovaries (the organs that produce the eggs (called oocytes)) to increase the number of available oocytes. The main side effects of these drugs are multiple pregnancy (production of two or more embryos (early stage in the development of a baby)) and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS; the ovaries produce too many eggs). In IVF and ICSI, the fertilisation (where the egg and sperm are together and produce an embryo) is outside the body. The oocytes are retrieved from the woman using an ultrasound\\u2010guided needle, piercing the vaginal wall to reach the ovaries. Through this needle, follicular fluid, which contains the oocyte, can be aspirated. It is common to remove between 10 and 15 oocytes. In IVF, the eggs are mixed with the sperm in a culture dish. In ICSI, sperm are injected directly into the oocytes to cause fertilisation. The fertilised oocytes are treated for two to six days in a medium that contains nutrients and are then placed in the uterus. \\nStudy characteristics \\nWe searched medical databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) investigating male subfertility. We found 10 randomised controlled trials, all comparing different treatments for couples with male subfertility, with a total of 757 couples. The studies evaluated the following treatment options: timed intercourse (TI; where sex occurred at a recommended time in the menstrual cycle) (with or without OH), IUI (with or without OH), IVF and ICSI. The evidence was current to April 2015. We were mainly interested in how many women had live births and OHSS. \\nKey results \\nWe found no evidence of a difference in live birth or pregnancy rates between treatments. We also found no evidence of a difference between any of the groups in rates of adverse effects (multiple pregnancy, miscarriage). Available data on OHSS was too limited for us to draw any conclusions.\",\n          \"Zuclopenthixol acetate for acute schizophrenia and similar serious mental illnesses\\nPeople with schizophrenia or other mental health problems often hear disturbing voices or see distressing things (which are called delusions, hallucinations and psychosis). Such experiences can be frightening and may lead people to be aggressive or show violent behaviour toward themselves or other people.\\u00a0Tranquilising drugs are medications that help people to sleep or calm down, and help stop aggressive or disorganised behaviour.\\u00a0An antipsychotic effect is also desirable to help stop the delusions and hallucinations. Tranquillisers should not have to be used often and also have few unwanted side\\u2010effects, such as pain at the injection site or uncontrolled shaking of the head and hands. Zuclopenthixol acetate is said to possess all these properties. \\u00a0 \\nZuclopenthixol acetate is given by an injection and has an effect that lasts for about two to three days. This review looks at zuclopenthixol acetate for managing aggression or violence.\\u00a0The review did not find any evidence that zuclopenthixol acetate is more or less effective in helping to control aggression or violence, or in preventing unwanted side\\u2010effects than other drugs (such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, clothiapine). It did not seem to work quickly and/or be rapid in calming people down.\\u00a0 \\nZuclopenthixol acetate may result in less forced injections (where restraint of the patient is needed to enable treatment).\\u00a0Low doses of the drug (as low as 25 mg) may be just as good and effective as higher doses (up to 100 mg).\\u00a0 \\nOverall the review found limited information for claims made to support the use of this drug (for example: that it rapidly calms or sedates people; or that it is better than other drugs in emergency situations). Recommendations on the use of zuclopenthixol acetate for aggressive or violent behaviour therefore have to be viewed with caution. \\u00a0 \\nEvidence is very far from good and convincing.\\u00a0Most of the research on the subject is small in size, with few participants, of short duration and data poorly reported in the individual studies. But it does point to zuclopenthixol acetate being helpful for managing very disturbed people. In comparison to other drugs it is not any worse than others.\\u00a0Moreover, the whole area on the management of very disturbed people is under\\u2010researched and more research is necessary.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"non_pls\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"From 6168 studies identified in the searches, 41 RCTs with a total of 6858 participants were included. Methodological quality ratings ranged from 1 to 9 out 12, and 13 of the 41 included studies were assessed as low risk of bias. Pooled estimates from 16 RCTs provided moderate to low quality evidence that MBR is more effective than usual care in reducing pain and disability, with standardised mean differences (SMDs) in the long term of 0.21 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.37) and 0.23 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.4) respectively. The range across all time points equated to approximately 0.5 to 1.4 units on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale for pain and 1.4 to 2.5 points on the Roland Morris disability scale (0 to 24). There was moderate to low quality evidence of no difference on work outcomes (odds ratio (OR) at long term 1.04, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.47). Pooled estimates from 19 RCTs provided moderate to low quality evidence that MBR was more effective than physical treatment for pain and disability with SMDs in the long term of 0.51 (95% CI \\u20100.01 to 1.04) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.16 to 1.19) respectively. Across all time points this translated to approximately 0.6 to 1.2 units on the pain scale and 1.2 to 4.0 points on the Roland Morris scale. There was moderate to low quality evidence of an effect on work outcomes (OR at long term 1.87, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.53). There was insufficient evidence to assess whether MBR interventions were associated with more adverse events than usual care or physical interventions.\",\n          \"Background\\nIntra\\u2010uterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are frequently used fertility treatments for couples with male subfertility. The use of these treatments has been subject of discussion. Knowledge on the effectiveness of fertility treatments for male subfertility with different grades of severity is limited. Possibly, couples are exposed to unnecessary or ineffective treatments on a large scale. \\nObjectives\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different fertility treatments (expectant management, timed intercourse (TI), IUI, IVF and ICSI) for couples whose subfertility appears to be due to abnormal sperm parameters. \\nSearch methods\\nWe searched for all publications that described randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the treatment for male subfertility. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and the National Research Register from inception to 14 April 2015, and web\\u2010based trial registers from January 1985 to April 2015. We applied no language restrictions. We checked all references in the identified trials and background papers and contacted authors to identify relevant published and unpublished data. \\nSelection criteria\\nWe included RCTs comparing different treatment options for male subfertility. These were expectant management, TI (with or without ovarian hyperstimulation (OH)), IUI (with or without OH), IVF and ICSI. We included only couples with abnormal sperm parameters. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors independently selected the studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. They resolved disagreements by discussion with the rest of the review authors. We performed statistical analyses in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by The Cochrane Collaboration. The quality of the evidence was rated using the GRADE methods. Primary outcomes were live birth and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) per couple randomised. \\nMain results\\nThe review included 10 RCTs (757 couples). The quality of the evidence was low or very low for all comparisons. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to describe study methods, serious imprecision and inconsistency. \\nIUI versus TI (five RCTs) \\nTwo RCTs compared IUI with TI in natural cycles. There were no data on live birth or OHSS. We found no evidence of a difference in pregnancy rates (2 RCTs, 62 couples: odds ratio (OR) 4.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 102, very low quality evidence; there were no events in one of the studies). \\nThree RCTs compared IUI with TI both in cycles with OH. We found no evidence of a difference in live birth rates (1 RCT, 81 couples: OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.59; low quality evidence) or pregnancy rates (3 RCTs, 202 couples: OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.74 to 3.07; I2 = 11%, very low quality evidence). One RCT reported data on OHSS. None of the 62 women had OHSS. \\nOne RCT compared IUI in cycles with OH with TI in natural cycles. We found no evidence of a difference in live birth rates (1 RCT, 44 couples: OR 3.14, 95% CI 0.12 to 81.35; very low quality evidence). Data on OHSS were not available. \\nIUI in cycles with OH versus IUI in natural cycles (five RCTs) \\nWe found no evidence of a difference in live birth rates (3 RCTs, 346 couples: OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.33; I2 = 0%, very low quality evidence) and pregnancy rates (4 RCTs, 399 couples: OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.82; I2 = 0%, very low quality evidence). There were no data on OHSS. \\nIVF versus IUI in natural cycles or cycles with OH (two RCTs) \\nWe found no evidence of a difference in live birth rates between IVF versus IUI in natural cycles (1 RCT, 53 couples: OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.35; low quality evidence) or IVF versus IUI in cycles with OH (2 RCTs, 86 couples: OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.45; I2 = 0%, very low quality evidence). One RCT reported data on OHSS. None of the women had OHSS. \\nOverall, we found no evidence of a difference between any of the groups in rates of live birth, pregnancy or adverse events (multiple pregnancy, miscarriage). However, most of the evidence was very low quality. \\nThere were no studies on IUI in natural cycles versus TI in stimulated cycles, IVF versus TI, ICSI versus TI, ICSI versus IUI (with OH) or ICSI versus IVF. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nWe found insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any difference in safety and effectiveness between different treatments for male subfertility. More research is needed.\",\n          \"We found no data for the primary outcome, tranquillisation. Compared with haloperidol, zuclopenthixol acetate was no more sedating at two hours (n = 40, 1 RCT, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.34). People given zuclopenthixol acetate were not at reduced risk of being given supplementary antipsychotics (n = 134, 3 RCTs, RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.30) although additional use of benzodiazepines was less (n = 50, 1 RCT, RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.47). People given zuclopenthixol acetate had fewer injections over seven days compared with those allocated to haloperidol IM (n = 70, 1 RCT, RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.84, NNT 4, CI 3 to 14). We found no data on more episodes of aggression or harm to self or others. One trial (n = 148) reported no significant difference in adverse effects for people receiving zuclopenthixol acetate compared with those allocated haloperidol at one, three and six days (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.27). Compared with haloperidol or clotiapine, people allocated zuclopenthixol did not seem to be at more risk of a range of movement disorders (< 20%). Three studies found no difference in the proportion of people getting blurred vision/dry mouth (n = 192, 2 RCTs, RR at 24 hours 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.70). Similarly, dizziness was equally infrequent for those allocated zuclopenthixol acetate compared with haloperidol (n = 192, 2 RCTs, RR at 24 hours 1.15, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.88). There was no difference between treatments for leaving the study before completion (n = 522, RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.31). One study reported no difference in adverse effects and outcome scores, when high dose (50\\u2010100 mg/injection) zuclopenthixol acetate was compared with low dose (25\\u201050 mg/injection) zuclopenthixol acetate.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

            "We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two trials registers on 20 April 2021. We searched two other databases up to 31 March 2020. We also conducted reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. \n",
            "Selection criteria\n",
            "Randomised trials that compared an individualised discharge plan with routine discharge that was not tailored to individual participants. Participants were hospital inpatients. \n",
            "Data collection and analysis\n",
            "Two review authors independently undertook data analysis and quality assessment using a pre‐designed data extraction sheet. We grouped studies by older people with a medical condition, people recovering from surgery, and studies that recruited participants with a mix of conditions. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data using fixed‐effect meta‐analysis. When combining outcome data it was not possible because of differences in the reporting of outcomes, we summarised the reported results for each trial in the text. \n",
            "Main results\n",
            "We included 33 trials (12,242 participants), four new trials included in this update. The majority of trials (N = 30) recruited participants with a medical diagnosis, average age range 60 to 84 years; four of these trials also recruited participants who were in hospital for a surgical procedure. Participants allocated to discharge planning and who were in hospital for a medical condition had a small reduction in the initial hospital length of stay (MD − 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) − 1.33 to − 0.12; 11 trials, 2113 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and a relative reduction in readmission to hospital over an average of three months follow‐up (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97; 17 trials, 5126 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There was little or no difference in participant's health status (mortality at three‐ to nine‐month follow‐up: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.29; 8 trials, 2721 participants; moderate certainty) functional status and psychological health measured by a range of measures, 12 studies, 2927 participants;  low certainty evidence). There was some evidence that satisfaction might be increased for patients (7 trials), caregivers (1 trial) or healthcare professionals (2 trials) (very low certainty evidence). The cost of a structured discharge plan compared with routine discharge is uncertain (7 trials recruiting 7873 participants with a medical condition; very low certainty evidence). \n",
            "Authors' conclusions\n",
            "A structured discharge plan that is tailored to the individual patient probably brings about a small reduction in the initial hospital length of stay and readmissions to hospital for older people with a medical condition, may slightly increase patient satisfaction with healthcare received. The impact on patient health status and healthcare resource use or cost to the health service is uncertain.\n",

We found no trials of freestanding birth centres or Snoezelen rooms. Allocation to an alternative setting increased the likelihood of: no intrapartum analgesia/anesthesia (six trials, n = 8953; RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.33); spontaneous vaginal birth (eight trials; n = 11,202; RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05); breastfeeding at six to eight weeks (one trial, n = 1147; RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.06); and very positive views of care (two trials, n = 1207; RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.15). Allocation to an alternative setting decreased the likelihood of epidural analgesia (eight trials, n = 10.931; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.87); oxytocin augmentation of labour (eight trials, n = 11,131; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.88); instrumental vaginal birth (eight trials, n = 11,202; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99), and episiotomy (eight trials, n = 11,055; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.90). There was no apparent effect on other adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes. Care by the same or separate staff had no apparent effects. No conclusions could be drawn regarding the effects of continuity of caregiver or architectural characteristics. In several of the trials included in this review, the design features of the alternative setting were confounded by important differences in the organizational models for care (separate staff for the alternative setting, offering more continuity of caregiver), and thus it is difficult to draw inferences about the independent effects of the physical birth environment.\\n\\n### Simplified text:\\n', 'response': \"Alternative versus conventional institutional settings for birth\\nIn high‐ and moderate‐income countries, labour wards have become the settings for childbirth for the majority of childbearing women. Routine medical interventions have also increased steadily over time, leading to many questions about benefits, safety, and risk for healthy childbearing women. The design of conventional hospital labour rooms is similar to the design of other hospital sick rooms, i.e. the hospital bed is a central feature of the room, and medical equipment is in plain view. In an effort to support normal labour and birth for healthy childbearing women, a variety of institutional maternity care settings have been constructed. Some are 'home‐like' bedrooms within hospital labour wards. Others are 'home‐like' birthing units adjacent to the labour wards. Others are freestanding birth centres. More recently, 'ambient' and Snoezelen rooms have been constructed within labour wards; these rooms are not home‐like but contain a variety of sensory stimuli and furnishings designed to promote feelings of calmness, control, and freedom of movement. \\nThe primary aim of this review is to evaluate the effects, on labour and birth outcomes, of care in an alternative institutional birth setting compared with care in a conventional hospital labour ward. We included ten trials involving 11,795 women. We found no trials of freestanding birth centres. When compared to conventional institutional settings, alternative settings were associated with reduced likelihood of medical interventions, increased likelihood of spontaneous vaginal birth, increased maternal satisfaction, and greater likelihood of continued breastfeeding at one to two months postpartum, with no apparent risks to mother or baby. Unfortunately, in several trials, the design features of the alternative setting were confounded by differences in the organizational models of care (including separate staff and more continuity of caregiver in the alternative setting), and thus it is not possible to draw conclusions about the independent effects of the design of the birth environment. We conclude that women and policy makers should be informed about the benefits of institutional settings which focus on supporting normal labour and birth.\"}\n"

            "External cephalic version (ECV) of the breech fetus at term (after 37 weeks) has been shown to be effective in reducing the number of breech presentations and caesarean sections, but the rates of success are relatively low. This review examines studies initiating ECV prior to term (before 37 weeks' gestation). \n",
            "Objectives\n",
            "To assess the effectiveness of a policy of beginning ECV before term (before 37 weeks' gestation) for breech presentation on fetal presentation at birth, method of delivery, and the rate of preterm birth, perinatal morbidity, stillbirth or neonatal mortality. \n",
            "Search methods\n",
            "We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. \n",
            "Selection criteria\n",
            "Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ECV attempted before term (37 weeks' gestation) or commenced before term, compared with a control group of women (in breech presentation) in which either no ECV attempted or ECV was attempted at term. Cluster‐randomised trials were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Quasi‐RCTs or studies using a cross‐over design were not eligible for inclusion. \n",
            "Data collection and analysis\n",
            "Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked for accuracy. Studies were assessed for risk of bias and for important outcomes the overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. \n",
            "Main results\n",
            "Five studies are included (2187 women). It was not possible for the intervention to be blinded, and it is not clear what impact lack of blinding would have on the outcomes reported. For other 'Risk of bias' domains studies were either at low or unclear risk of bias. \n",
            "One study reported on ECV that was undertaken and completed before 37 weeks' gestation compared with no ECV. No difference was found in the rate of non‐cephalic presentation at birth (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.69; participants = 102). One study reported on a policy of ECV that was initiated before term (33 weeks) and up until 40 weeks' gestation and which could be repeated up until delivery compared with no ECV. This study showed a decrease in the rate of non‐cephalic presentation at birth (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.77; participants = 179). \n",
            "Three studies reported on ECV started at between 34 to 35 weeks' gestation compared with beginning at 37 to 38 weeks' gestation. Pooled results suggested that early ECV reduced the risk of non‐cephalic presentation at birth (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.90; participants = 1906; studies = three; I² = 0%, evidence graded high quality), failure to achieve vaginal cephalic birth (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.97; participants = 1888; studies = three; I² = 0%, evidence graded high quality), and vaginal breech delivery (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.78; participants = 1888; studies = three; I² = 0%, evidence graded high quality). The difference between groups for risk of caesarean was not statistically significant (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00; participants = 1888; studies = three; I² = 0%, evidence graded high quality). There was evidence that risk of preterm labour was increased with early ECV compared with ECV after 37 weeks (6.6% in the ECV group and 4.3% for controls) (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.21; participants = 1888; studies = three; I² = 0%, evidence graded high quality). There was no clear difference between groups for low infant Apgar score at five minutes or perinatal death (stillbirth plus neonatal mortality up to seven days) (evidence graded as low quality for both outcomes). \n",
            "Authors' conclusions\n",
            "Compared with no ECV attempt, ECV commenced before term reduces non‐cephalic presentation at birth. Compared with ECV at term, beginning ECV at between 34 to 35 weeks may have some benefit in terms of decreasing the rate of non‐cephalic presentation, and risk of vaginal breech birth. However, early ECV may increase risk of late preterm birth, and it is important that any future research reports infant morbidity outcomes. Results of the review suggest that there is a need for careful discussion with women about the timing of the ECV procedure so that they can make informed decisions.\n",

Whilst abnormal menstrual bleeding may be associated with underlying pathology, in the present context, HMB is defined as excessive menstrual bleeding in the absence of other systemic or gynaecological disease. The first\\u2010line therapy is usually medical, avoiding possibly unnecessary surgery. Of the wide variety of medications used to reduce HMB, oral progestogens were originally the most commonly prescribed agents. This review assesses the effectiveness of two different types and regimens of oral progestogens in reducing ovulatory HMB. \\nThis is the update of a Cochrane review last updated in 2007, and originally named \\\"Effectiveness of cyclical progestagen therapy in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding\\\" (1998). \\nObjectives\\nTo determine the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of oral progestogen therapy taken either during the luteal phase (short cycle) or for a longer course of 21 days per cycle (long cycle), in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood loss in women of reproductive age with HMB. \\nSearch methods\\nIn January 2019 we searched Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility's specialized register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycInfo. We also searched trials registers, other sources of unpublished or grey literature and reference lists of retrieved trials. We also checked citation lists of review articles to identify trials. \\nSelection criteria\\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatments for HMB that included cyclical oral progestogens were eligible. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for clarification of methods or additional data when necessary. We only assessed adverse events if they were separately measured in the included trials. We compared cyclical oral progestogen in different regimens and placebo or other treatments. Our primary outcomes were menstrual blood loss and satisfaction with treatment; the secondary outcomes were number of days of bleeding, quality of life, compliance and acceptability of treatment, adverse events and costs. \\nMain results\\nThis review identified 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1071 women in total. Most of the women knew which treatment they were receiving, which may have influenced their judgements about menstrual blood loss and satisfaction. Other aspects of trial quality varied among trials. \\nWe did not identify any RCTs comparing progestogen treatment with placebo. We assessed comparisons between oral progestogens and other medical therapies separately according to different regimens. \\nShort\\u2010cycle progestogen therapy during the luteal phase (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone for 7 to 10 days, from day 15 to 19) was inferior to other medical therapy, including tranexamic acid, danazol and the progestogen\\u2010releasing intrauterine system (Pg\\u2010IUS (off the market since 2001)), releasing 60 mcg of progesterone daily, with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss (mean difference (MD) 37.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 17.67 to 56.91; I2 = 50%; 6 trials, 145 women, low\\u2010quality evidence). The rate of satisfaction and the quality of life with treatment was similar in both groups. The number of bleeding days was greater on the short cycle progestogen group compared to other medical treatments. Adverse events (such as gastrointestinal symptoms and weight gain) were more likely with danazol when compared with progestogen treatment. We note that danazol is no longer in general use for treating HMB. \\nLong\\u2010cycle progestogen therapy (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone), from day 5 to day 26 of the menstrual cycle, is also inferior compared to the levonorgestrel\\u2010releasing intrauterine system (LNG\\u2010IUS), tranexamic acid and ormeloxifene, but may be similar to the combined vaginal ring with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss (MD 16.88, 95% CI 10.93 to 22.84; I2 = 87%; 4 trials, 355 women, very low\\u2010quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of a difference between progestogen therapy long cycle and other medical therapy in terms of headache (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.40 to 5.31; I2 = 0%; 2 trials, 189 women; low\\u2010quality evidence). Breakthrough bleeding or spotting was more likely in women with the LNG\\u2010IUS (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.55; I2 = 0%; 3 trials, 220 women; low\\u2010quality evidence). No trials reported on days of bleeding or quality of life for this comparison. \\nThe evidence supporting these findings was limited by low or very low gradings of quality; thus, we are uncertain about the findings and there is a potential that they may change if we identify other trials. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nLow\\u2010 or very low\\u2010quality evidence suggests that short\\u2010course progestogen was inferior to other medical therapy, including tranexamic acid, danazol and the Pg\\u2010IUS with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss. Long cycle progestogen therapy (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone) was also inferior to the LNG\\u2010IUS, tranexamic acid and ormeloxifene, but may be similar to the combined vaginal ring with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss.\\n\\n### Simplified text:\\n\",\n          \"Rewrite the following medical text in simple, clear English suitable for the general public.\\n- Use short sentences\\n- Use common words\\n- Keep all important facts\\n- DO NOT copy the original text\\n\\n### Original text:\\nWe included 11 trials involving 2100 participants undergoing 2304 CEA operations. The quality of trials was generally poor. Follow\\u2010up varied from hospital discharge to five years. Compared with primary closure, carotid patch angioplasty may make little or no difference to reduction in risk of any stroke during the perioperative period (odds ratio (OR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 1.03; P = 0.063; 8 studies, 1769 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence), but may lower the risk of any stroke during long\\u2010term follow\\u2010up (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.90; P = 0.022; 7 studies, 1332 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). In the included studies, carotid patch angioplasty resulted in a lower risk of ipsilateral stroke during the perioperative period (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.63; P = 0.001; 7 studies, 1201 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence), and during long\\u2010term follow\\u2010up (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.63; P = 0.001; 6 studies, 1141 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). The intervention was associated with a reduction in the risk of any stroke or death during long\\u2010term follow\\u2010up (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.84; P = 0.003; 6 studies, 1019 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). In addition, the included studies suggest that carotid patch angioplasty may reduce the risk of perioperative arterial occlusion (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.41; P < 0.0001; 7 studies, 1435 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence), and may reduce the risk of restenosis during long\\u2010term follow\\u2010up (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.34; P < 0.00001; 8 studies, 1719 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence). The studies recorded very few arterial complications, including haemorrhage, infection, cranial nerve palsies and pseudo\\u2010aneurysm formation, with either patch or primary closure. We found no correlation between the use of patch angioplasty and the risk of either perioperative or long\\u2010term stroke\\u2010related death or all\\u2010cause death rates.\\n\\n### Simplified text:\\n\",\n          \"Rewrite the following medical text in simple, clear English suitable for the general public.\\n- Use short sentences\\n- Use common words\\n- Keep all important facts\\n- DO NOT copy the original text\\n\\n### Original text:\\nNine studies compared multivitamins with placebo (7 studies) or no treatment (2 studies) in people with early and moderate AMD. The duration of supplementation and follow\\u2010up ranged from nine months to six years; one trial followed up beyond two years. Most evidence came from the Age\\u2010Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) in the USA. People taking antioxidant vitamins were less likely to progress to late AMD (odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.90; 2445 participants; 3 RCTs; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence). In people with very early signs of AMD, who are at low risk of progression, this would mean that there would be approximately 4 fewer cases of progression to late AMD for every 1000 people taking vitamins (1 fewer to 6 fewer cases). In people at high risk of progression (i.e. people with moderate AMD) this would correspond to approximately 8 fewer cases of progression for every 100 people taking vitamins (3 fewer to 13 fewer). In one study of 1206 people, there was a lower risk of progression for both neovascular AMD (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.82; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence) and geographic atrophy (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.10; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence) and a lower risk of losing 3 or more lines of visual acuity (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.96; 1791 participants; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence). Low\\u2010certainty evidence from one study of 110 people suggested higher quality of life scores (National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire) in treated compared with the non\\u2010treated people after 24 months (mean difference (MD) 12.30, 95% CI 4.24 to 20.36).  Six studies compared lutein (with or without zeaxanthin) with placebo. The duration of supplementation and follow\\u2010up ranged from six months to five years. Most evidence came from the AREDS2 study in the USA. People taking lutein or zeaxanthin may have similar or slightly reduced risk of progression to late AMD (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.01; 6891 eyes; low\\u2010certainty evidence), neovascular AMD (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.02; 6891 eyes; low\\u2010certainty evidence), and geographic atrophy (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05; 6891 eyes; low\\u2010certainty evidence). A similar risk of progression to visual loss of 15 or more letters was seen in the lutein and control groups (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.05; 6656 eyes; low\\u2010certainty evidence). Quality of life (measured with Visual Function Questionnaire) was similar between groups in one study of 108 participants (MD 1.48, 95% \\u20105.53 to 8.49, moderate\\u2010certainty evidence).  One study, conducted in Australia, compared vitamin E with placebo. This study randomised 1204 people to vitamin E or placebo, and followed up for four years. Participants were enrolled from the general population; 19% had AMD. The number of late AMD events was low (N = 7) and the estimate of effect was uncertain (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.31 to 6.05, very low\\u2010certainty evidence). There were no data on neovascular AMD or geographic atrophy.There was no evidence of any effect of treatment on visual loss (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.47, low\\u2010certainty evidence). There were no data on quality of life.  Five studies compared zinc with placebo. The duration of supplementation and follow\\u2010up ranged from six months to seven years. People taking zinc supplements may be less likely to progress to late AMD (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.98; 3790 participants; 3 RCTs; low\\u2010certainty evidence), neovascular AMD (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.93; 2442 participants; 1 RCT; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence), geographic atrophy (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.10; 2442 participants; 1 RCT; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence), or visual loss (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.00; 3791 participants; 2 RCTs; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence). There were no data reported on quality of life.\\n\\n### Simplified text:\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Are cyclical progestogens an effective and safe treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding compared to other medical treatments? \\nBackground \\nHeavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is menstrual bleeding (periods) that interferes with a woman's quality of life, either physical, emotional, social or material, independently of the actual amount of blood loss. Most women with HMB do not have any associated physical cause, such as fibroids, so getting help that does not involve surgery is an attractive alternative. A cyclical progestogen is a hormone tablet that can be taken by mouth for either 10 days or 3 to 4 weeks per month for the treatment of HMB (short or long course cyclical progestogen). \\nTrial characteristics \\nThis review identified 15 randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 1071 women in total comparing oral progestogens to other medical treatment for HMB (other oral treatments, intrauterine device and vaginal ring). Our primary outcomes were menstrual blood loss and satisfaction with treatment; the secondary outcomes were number of days of bleeding, quality of life, compliance and acceptability of treatment, adverse events and costs. Evidence is current to January 2019. \\nKey results \\nThis review of trials found that progestogen hormone tablets taken by mouth for 10 days per month (short course) were less effective at reducing menstrual blood loss when compared to other medical treatments. We are uncertain whether they improved satisfaction or quality of life in women with HMB, or were associated with any difference in adverse effects when compared to other medical treatments. Even though it was less effective at reducing menstrual blood loss, satisfaction with treatment was similar to other medical treatments such as tranexamic acid and Pg\\u2010IUS. \\nWe found that progestogen hormone tablets, taken by mouth for three to four weeks from day 5 to 26 of the menstrual cycle (long course), reduced menstrual blood loss but this treatment may be less effective than tranexamic acid, combined hormonal contraceptives and the levonorgestrel\\u2010releasing intrauterine device. No studies in this comparison reported on quality of life. Satisfaction with treatment was similar to women using the combined vaginal ring, but there were no data to compare satisfaction between long cycle and LNG\\u2010IUS or tranexamic acid. There was no evidence of a difference in the occurrence of headache, but long course oral progestogens were associated with a significantly lower incidence of breakthrough bleeding compared with other medical treatment.\",\n          \"Patch angioplasty versus primary closure for carotid endarterectomy\\nKey messagesEleven trials involving 2100 people now suggest a possible benefit from using a special procedure (patch angioplasty) following carotid endarterectomy. \\nWhat is carotid endarterectomy?About 20% of strokes result from narrowing of the carotid artery (the main artery supplying blood to the brain). A narrowed carotid artery can be treated with a surgical procedure called carotid endarterectomy, which involves cutting the artery open and removing fatty substances called plaques. This widens the artery and so reduces the risk of stroke. However, there is a small possibility that the operation itself can cause a stroke. \\nWhat is primary closure, and what is patch angioplasty?After removing the plaques from the artery, the surgeon can simply bring the two edges of the hole together and sew it closed (primary closure), or can close the hole with a patch, sewing the edges of the hole to the edges of the patch to widen the artery further (patch angioplasty). This patch can be made of synthetic material or can be a piece of the patient's own vein. \\nWhat did we want to find out?We wanted to find out if people who have people patch angioplasty after carotid endarterectomy \\u2013 compared with those who have primary closure \\u2013 have less chance of having a stroke or dying in the short or long term after the operation, or have less chance of their artery narrowing again, without suffering many more complications around the time of the operation. \\nWhat did we do?We searched for studies that compared patch angioplasty and primary closure in people who had carotid endarterectomy. We compared and summarised the results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and study size. \\nWhat did we find?We found 11 studies involving 2100 participants undergoing 2304 carotid endarterectomy operations. The studies were conducted all around the world.\\u00a0 \\nMain resultsPatch angioplasty lowered the risk of stroke in the short and long term after surgery compared with primary closure. Patch angioplasty may reduce the risk of the artery becoming blocked and the risk of the patient having a stroke or dying in the long term. \\nMain limitations of the evidenceSome studies monitored participants for up to five years, while others stopped monitoring participants after they left hospital. This makes us uncertain about the evidence.\",\n          \"Antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements to slow down the progression of age\\u2010related macular degeneration (AMD) \\nWhat is the aim of this review?  The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether taking antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements slows down the progression of AMD and prevents visual loss. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 19 studies. \\nKey messages  Taking an antioxidant multivitamin supplement may slow down the progression of AMD. Most benefit will be seen in people who have a higher chance of progression. Although vitamin supplements are generally regarded as safe, the studies included in this review did not provide good evidence as to safety as they were generally too small. \\nWhat was studied in the review?  AMD is a condition of the central area (macula) of the back of the eye (retina). The macula degenerates with age. In some people, this deterioration happens more quickly, and is associated with a particular appearance at the back of the eye. In its earliest stage (early AMD), yellow spots (drusen) can be seen under the retina by an eye health professional on examining the eye. The affected person will probably be unaware that they a problem. As AMD progresses, it can lead to the loss of the cells in the back of the eye, which are needed for vision. This is known as geographic atrophy. Sometimes, new (harmful) blood vessels grow in the macula. These new blood vessels may bleed and cause scarring. This is known as neovascular or wet AMD. Any damage to the macula can affect vision, particularly central vision. Neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy are known as late AMD. \\nIt is possible that antioxidant vitamins may help to protect the macula against this deterioration and loss of vision. Vitamin C, E, beta\\u2010carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and zinc are examples of antioxidant vitamins commonly found in vitamin supplements. \\nThe Cochrane researchers only looked at the effects of these supplements in people with AMD. There is another Cochrane Review on the effects of these supplements in people who do not already have AMD. \\nWhat are the main results of the review?  The Cochrane researchers found 19 relevant studies. Ten studies were from Europe, six from USA, two from China, and one from Australia. These studies compared multivitamin supplements, zinc, vitamin E and lutein and zeaxanthin with placebo. \\n\\u2022Taking antioxidant vitamins plus zinc probably slows down the progression to late AMD and vision loss (moderate\\u2010certainty evidence). This may result in a small improvement in quality of life (low\\u2010certainty evidence). \\u2022Taking lutein alone (or combined with zeaxanthin) may have little or no effect on progression to late AMD and vision loss (low\\u2010certainty evidence). \\u2022Taking vitamin E alone may have little or no effect on the progression to late AMD and vision loss (low\\u2010certainty evidence). \\nAlthough vitamin supplements are generally regarded as safe, the studies included in this review did not provide good evidence as to safety as they were generally too small and adverse effects were reported inconsistently.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Rewrite the following medical text in simple, clear English suitable for the general public.\\n- Use short sentences\\n- Use common words\\n- Keep all important facts\\n- DO NOT copy the original text\\n\\n### Original text:\\nBackground\\nHeavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a menstrual blood loss perceived by women as excessive that affects the health of women of reproductive age, interfering with their physical, emotional, social and material quality of life.

We also checked citation lists of review articles to identify trials. \\nSelection criteria\\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatments for HMB that included cyclical oral progestogens were eligible. \\nData collection and analysis\\nTwo review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for clarification of methods or additional data when necessary. We only assessed adverse events if they were separately measured in the included trials. We compared cyclical oral progestogen in different regimens and placebo or other treatments. Our primary outcomes were menstrual blood loss and satisfaction with treatment; the secondary outcomes were number of days of bleeding, quality of life, compliance and acceptability of treatment, adverse events and costs. \\nMain results\\nThis review identified 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1071 women in total. Most of the women knew which treatment they were receiving, which may have influenced their judgements about menstrual blood loss and satisfaction. Other aspects of trial quality varied among trials. \\nWe did not identify any RCTs comparing progestogen treatment with placebo. We assessed comparisons between oral progestogens and other medical therapies separately according to different regimens. \\nShort\\u2010cycle progestogen therapy during the luteal phase (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone for 7 to 10 days, from day 15 to 19) was inferior to other medical therapy, including tranexamic acid, danazol and the progestogen\\u2010releasing intrauterine system (Pg\\u2010IUS (off the market since 2001)), releasing 60 mcg of progesterone daily, with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss (mean difference (MD) 37.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 17.67 to 56.91; I2 = 50%; 6 trials, 145 women, low\\u2010quality evidence). The rate of satisfaction and the quality of life with treatment was similar in both groups. The number of bleeding days was greater on the short cycle progestogen group compared to other medical treatments. Adverse events (such as gastrointestinal symptoms and weight gain) were more likely with danazol when compared with progestogen treatment. We note that danazol is no longer in general use for treating HMB. \\nLong\\u2010cycle progestogen therapy (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone), from day 5 to day 26 of the menstrual cycle, is also inferior compared to the levonorgestrel\\u2010releasing intrauterine system (LNG\\u2010IUS), tranexamic acid and ormeloxifene, but may be similar to the combined vaginal ring with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss (MD 16.88, 95% CI 10.93 to 22.84; I2 = 87%; 4 trials, 355 women, very low\\u2010quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of a difference between progestogen therapy long cycle and other medical therapy in terms of headache (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.40 to 5.31; I2 = 0%; 2 trials, 189 women; low\\u2010quality evidence). Breakthrough bleeding or spotting was more likely in women with the LNG\\u2010IUS (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.55; I2 = 0%; 3 trials, 220 women; low\\u2010quality evidence). No trials reported on days of bleeding or quality of life for this comparison. \\nThe evidence supporting these findings was limited by low or very low gradings of quality; thus, we are uncertain about the findings and there is a potential that they may change if we identify other trials. \\nAuthors' conclusions\\nLow\\u2010 or very low\\u2010quality evidence suggests that short\\u2010course progestogen was inferior to other medical therapy, including tranexamic acid, danazol and the Pg\\u2010IUS with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss. Long cycle progestogen therapy (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone) was also inferior to the LNG\\u2010IUS, tranexamic acid and ormeloxifene, but may be similar to the combined vaginal ring with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss.\\n\\n### Simplified text:\\n```\\nA woman\\u2019s menstruation can cause her body harm,\\nand it doesn\\u2019t matter who she wants what.\\u201d\\n--MENSTRATION DURING THE MEALING: A double-blind study of non-hormones food will take place at meal time until one week after six...\\na man asks questions asked he answers him does so ask why do you answer - Questions : What happens?

The quality of trials was generally poor. Follow\\u2010up varied from hospital discharge to five years. Compared with primary closure, carotid patch angioplasty may make little or no difference to reduction in risk of any stroke during the perioperative period (odds ratio (OR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 1.03; P = 0.063; 8 studies, 1769 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence), but may lower the risk of any stroke during long\\u2010term follow\\u2010up (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.90; P = 0.022; 7 studies, 1332 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). In the included studies, carotid patch angioplasty resulted in a lower risk of ipsilateral stroke during the perioperative period (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.63; P = 0.001; 7 studies, 1201 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence), and during long\\u2010term follow\\u2010up (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.63; P = 0.001; 6 studies, 1141 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). The intervention was associated with a reduction in the risk of any stroke or death during long\\u2010term follow\\u2010up (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.84; P = 0.003; 6 studies, 1019 participants; very low\\u2010certainty evidence). In addition, the included studies suggest that carotid patch angioplasty may reduce the risk of perioperative arterial occlusion (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.41; P < 0.0001; 7 studies, 1435 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence), and may reduce the risk of restenosis during long\\u2010term follow\\u2010up (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.34; P < 0.00001; 8 studies, 1719 participants; low\\u2010certainty evidence). The studies recorded very few arterial complications, including haemorrhage, infection, cranial nerve palsies and pseudo\\u2010aneurysm formation, with either patch or primary closure. We found no correlation between the use of patch angioplasty and the risk of either perioperative or long\\u2010term stroke\\u2010related death or all\\u2010cause death rates.\\n\\n### Simplified text:\\nCarotoid Patch Angiolpasty May Reduce Risk Of Restenalstion During Long-Term Follo-WWard A Study Efficacy And Safety On Carotoideal Patch Angleplatyfied With Rofe VVnNtS LqDlEaLsGjCgMwBvPQoRzYcZJxHbUdFkIuXhKrTxCkBPrOgLGrAICAnKCIGAOOCBCBGCCDCEDDGECFCFGFDHCHEGFHGHDIEHIIFGHIDIKGGILIHJKGIHKJIIBKGHLIJKBKLIMKIKNLMKMNOOPOPSQRSPSRTRSTSVSWTXUYUVWWWDWXZWXXYYZZ' is converted into 'Abel Mollis'. \\n\\n#### Text on Card:\\n\\n##### **Card Number:**<br>**XXXXXXX</*>\\n\\n## Data Analysis Project Proposal\\n\\n\\nData analysis project proposal: \\nThis data analytic research paper aims at providing valuable insights regarding business management practices.\\n\\n\\nBackground:\\n\\n\\nThe topic I will be researching about Business Management Practices has always been my interest because i am interested by how people manage their businesses without using software like Microsoft office\",\n          \"Rewrite the following medical text in simple, clear English suitable for the general public.\\n- Use short sentences\\n- Use common words\\n- Keep all important facts\\n- DO NOT copy the original text\\n\\n### Original text:\\nNine studies compared multivitamins with placebo (7 studies) or no treatment (2 studies) in people with early and moderate AMD. The duration of supplementation and follow\\u2010up ranged from nine months to six years; one trial followed up beyond two years. Most evidence came from the Age\\u2010Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) in the USA. People taking antioxidant vitamins were less likely to progress to late AMD (odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.90; 2445 participants; 3 RCTs; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence). In people with very early signs of AMD, who are at low risk of progression, this would mean that there would be approximately 4 fewer cases of progression to late AMD for every 1000 people taking vitamins (1 fewer to 6 fewer cases). In people at high risk of progression (i.e. people with moderate AMD) this would correspond to approximately 8 fewer cases of progression for every 100 people taking vitamins (3 fewer to 13 fewer). In one study of 1206 people, there was a lower risk of progression for both neovascular AMD (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.82; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence) and geographic atrophy (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.10; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence) and a lower risk of losing 3 or more lines of visual acuity (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.96; 1791 participants; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence). Low\\u2010certainty evidence from one study of 110 people suggested higher quality of life scores (National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire) in treated compared with the non\\u2010treated people after 24 months (mean difference (MD) 12.30, 95% CI 4.24 to 20.36).  Six studies compared lutein (with or without zeaxanthin) with placebo. The duration of supplementation and follow\\u2010up ranged from six months to five years. Most evidence came from the AREDS2 study in the USA. People taking lutein or zeaxanthin may have similar or slightly reduced risk of progression to late AMD (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.01; 6891 eyes; low\\u2010certainty evidence), neovascular AMD (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.02; 6891 eyes; low\\u2010certainty evidence), and geographic atrophy (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05; 6891 eyes; low\\u2010certainty evidence). A similar risk of progression to visual loss of 15 or more letters was seen in the lutein and control groups (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.05; 6656 eyes; low\\u2010certainty evidence). Quality of life (measured with Visual Function Questionnaire) was similar between groups in one study of 108 participants (MD 1.48, 95% \\u20105.53 to 8.49, moderate\\u2010certainty evidence).  One study, conducted in Australia, compared vitamin E with placebo. This study randomised 1204 people to vitamin E or placebo, and followed up for four years. Participants were enrolled from the general population; 19% had AMD. The number of late AMD events was low (N = 7) and the estimate of effect was uncertain (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.31 to 6.05, very low\\u2010certainty evidence). There were no data on neovascular AMD or geographic atrophy.There was no evidence of any effect of treatment on visual loss (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.47, low\\u2010certainty evidence). There were no data on quality of life.  Five studies compared zinc with placebo. The duration of supplementation and follow\\u2010up ranged from six months to seven years. People taking zinc supplements may be less likely to progress to late AMD (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.98; 3790 participants; 3 RCTs; low\\u2010certainty evidence), neovascular AMD (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.93; 2442 participants; 1 RCT; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence), geographic atrophy (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.10; 2442 participants; 1 RCT; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence), or visual loss (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.00; 3791 participants; 2 RCTs; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence).

Whilst abnormal menstrual bleeding may be associated with underlying pathology, in the present context, HMB is defined as excessive menstrual bleeding in the absence of other systemic or gynaecological disease. The first\\u2010line therapy is usually medical, avoiding possibly unnecessary surgery. Of the wide variety of medications used to reduce HMB, oral progestogens were originally the most commonly prescribed agents. This review assesses the effectiveness of two different types and regimens of oral progestogens in reducing ovulatory HMB. \\nThis is the update of a Cochrane review last updated in 2007, and originally named \\\"Effectiveness of cyclical progestagen therapy in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding\\\" (1998). \\nObjectives\\nTo determine the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of oral progestogen therapy taken either during the luteal phase (short cycle) or for a longer course of 21 days per cycle (long cycle), in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood loss in women of reproductive age with HMB. \\nSearch methods\\nIn January 2019 we searched Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility's specialized register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycInfo. We also searched trials registers, other sources of unpublished or grey literature and reference lists of retrieved trials.

There were no data on neovascular AMD or geographic atrophy.There was no evidence of any effect of treatment on visual loss (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.47, low\\u2010certainty evidence). There were no data on quality of life.  Five studies compared zinc with placebo. The duration of supplementation and follow\\u2010up ranged from six months to seven years. People taking zinc supplements may be less likely to progress to late AMD (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.98; 3790 participants; 3 RCTs; low\\u2010certainty evidence), neovascular AMD (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.93; 2442 participants; 1 RCT; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence), geographic atrophy (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.10; 2442 participants; 1 RCT; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence), or visual loss (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.00; 3791 participants; 2 RCTs; moderate\\u2010certainty evidence). There were no data reported on quality of life.\\n\\n### Simplified text:\\n\\\"the clinical trials will end by next week.\\\" \\\"The results should not change within these weeks.\\\"\\n\\n## Conclusion:-\\nIn our opinion it is possible due as we do nothing about cancer because even when they take an oath so does my husband I am afraid he says things like 'I can't believe you're doing what's making us feel' But He Does Not Remember How Many Times They Have To Go Back For Another Test And Every Time When You Reheat Your Body Temperature Goes Up So It Is Harder Than Me My Husband Says Things Like We Make Clothes Then What Do Our Mothers Say About Us?'\\nSo Let me TellYou Why At Each Point During Their Journey Into Space, These Were Some Facts That Are True Today : - If your child ever has a heart condition \\u2013 Ask Yourself :\\nWhat did today\\u2019s news say?\\nWe know why kids ask themselves.\\nIf parents want their own children...\\nIs God Created?\\nAlliance Theory refers here to each member.
